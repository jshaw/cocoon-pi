All this stuff goes in the sketchbook folder on the pi. 

I'll add another folder with the compatible arduino sketch.

Behaviours controlled by keyboard keypressed. The state reference number on keyboard. 

* 0: blinking per supplied beat
* 1: pulsates at a specific time (need to add the beat into this)

* 3: blinks to beat + moves
* 4: pulsates more quickly
* 5: blinks + pulsates more quickly
* 6: decreases diameter + pulsates in a hearbeat pattern
